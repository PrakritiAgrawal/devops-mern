## Product Management System
A full-stack product management system that allows users to manage products, 
filter them by price and gender, and perform admin-specific tasks like adding and listing products. 
The application is built using React for the frontend and Node.js with Express for the backend.

### Frontend
- User authentication (Signup and Login).
- Role-based access control (Admin and User roles).
- Product filtering by price and gender.
- UI with animations using Framer Motion.
- Admin-specific features:
  - Add new products.
  - View a list of all products.
 
### Backend
- RESTful API built with Node.js and Express.
- User authentication with JWT.
- Role-based middleware for admin-only routes.
- Product management endpoints (CRUD operations).
- Secure password storage using bcrypt.
- CORS enabled for cross-origin requests.

## Technologies Used

### Frontend
- React
- React Router
- Framer Motion
- Font Awesome
- CSS Modules

### Backend
- Node.js
